* The main task is to create **_TIC TAC TOE_** game.
1. Firstly I created a file of the game with _Math.random()_ function. Script works by itself randomly. [Here is the link.](https://github.com/VahePashayan/HomeWorks/blob/main/HW8/TicTacToe.js)

2. Then I created a file with the same game, but this time with _prompt_ function for two players. That means that to players provide coordinates manually. [Version with prompt.](https://github.com/VahePashayan/HomeWorks/blob/main/HW8/TicTacToeWithPrompt.js)
